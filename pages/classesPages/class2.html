                <h1>Color Theory</h1>

                <p>In this lesson, we explore Color Theory and its impact on users' visual perception in 
                    websites. We discussed how carefully choosing colors can significantly influence user 
                    experience, conveying feelings such as trust, urgency, or tranquility. Additionally, 
                    we covered color psychology, analyzing how different shades can evoke emotions and 
                    affect decision-making. These principles not only enhance visual aesthetics but also 
                    improve accessibility and usability in design projects.</p>

                <h1>Nielsen's 10 Heuristics</h1>
                <div class="nilsen">    
                    <p id="descriptionTopic">In this lesson, we explore Nielsen's 10 heuristics, a set 
                        of fundamental guidelines for evaluating and improving the usability of digital 
                        interfaces. These heuristics help develop more intuitive, efficient, and accessible 
                        interfaces for users</p>

                    <p><span>01 - Visibility of system status:</span> The interface should always keep the user informed about what is happening by providing timely and appropriate feedback.</p>
                    <p><span>02 - Match between system and the real world:</span> Communication should be clear and intuitive, using elements and terms familiar to the user to make interactions more natural.</p>
                    <p><span>03 - User control and freedom:</span> The design should allow users to have control over their actions, including options to undo or redo actions easily.</p>
                    <p><span>04 - Consistency and standards:</span> Maintaining visual and functional consistency prevents confusion, allowing users to understand and use the system without having to relearn basic interactions.</p>
                    <p><span>05 - Error prevention:</span> The design should minimize the likelihood of errors by offering suggestions, validations, and preventing incorrect actions before they happen.</p>
                    <img src="../../images/heuristics.jpg">
                    <p><span>06 - Recognition rather than recall:</span> Users should not have to remember information from one screen to another. Visible elements and clear instructions help guide navigation.</p>
                    <p><span>07 - Flexibility and efficiency of use:</span> The interface should be accessible to both novice and advanced users, allowing shortcuts and customizations for greater efficiency.</p>
                    <p><span>08 - Aesthetic and minimalist design:</span> Interfaces should display only essential information, avoiding unnecessary elements that may distract or overwhelm the user.</p>
                    <p><span>09 - Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:</span> Error messages should be clear and guide the user in resolving the issue efficiently.</p>
                    <p><span>10 - Help and documentation:</span> Although a well-designed system should be intuitive, providing support or documentation is essential to ensure users can easily find assistance when needed.</p>
