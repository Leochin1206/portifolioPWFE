                <p>This website was created to bring together the main concepts covered in our Front-End Web Programming classes. Here, 
                    you will find detailed explanations of the essential technologies for interface development, including HTML, CSS, 
                    and JavaScript, as well as fundamental UI/UX principles. Our goal is to provide clear and accessible support material 
                    to assist in learning and practicing these concepts. We explore everything from the basic structure of a web page to 
                    the dynamic manipulation of the DOM Tree, enabling students to develop interactive and functional websites. We also 
                    cover the importance of usability, presenting Nielsen's heuristics, which help create intuitive and efficient interfaces. 
                    Additionally, you will be able to review practical exercises applied in class, such as creating interactive forms, 
                    animations, and dynamic scripts.</p>

                <p>We also delve into JavaScript programming, highlighting its evolution from LiveScript to its significance in manipulating 
                    HTML and CSS. We learned how to use the "script" tag to integrate JavaScript into HTML and explored the DOM to modify 
                    elements dynamically. Furthermore, we worked with functions, conditionals, loops, and events, applying these concepts in 
                    practical exercises such as mathematical calculations, form validations, and even an interactive game.</p>
